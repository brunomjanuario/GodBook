# GodBook

A 24 hours Hackathon group project.

## The idea

Our project was based on the song "The Meaning Of Life", by Monty Python.

Our idea was to develop a platform where people from different backgrounds and with different life experiences could share their stories with people who feel lost, or are in need of different views about what is our purpose in this world.

If you need guidance, GodBook has you covered. If you feel like sharing but don't have anyone to talk to, GodBook has you covered.

## Development

We had sprints every four hours where we would check the team's progress, discuss the next steps and making sure we were all on the same page.

In the first sprint, we had a brainstorm session to decide what would our project be, which technologies to use and how to organise ourselves.

Then, we divided into 2 groups: one that would handle the back-end development and the other one that would focus on the front-end of our application.

 * Our back-end group focused on connecting to the database, setting all the models, services and controllers and also the API that we built in order to interact with the database.
 * On the other hand, the front-end group focused on the single page application implementation, as well as the structure and layout of the website.
